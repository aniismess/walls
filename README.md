# My Wallpaper Collection

Hey there! Welcome to my personal wallpaper collection. I've been gathering these over time, and I wanted a clean, organized place to keep them and share them with you. Think of this as my little digital art gallery, categorized to make it super easy for you to find something that catches your eye.

I've tried my best to sort them into logical categories, but sometimes a wallpaper might fit into more than one. If you think something's in the wrong place, or if you have suggestions, feel free to let me know!

## Abstract

This is where I keep wallpapers that focus on shapes, colors, and patterns rather than recognizable objects. They're great for a clean, modern look.
