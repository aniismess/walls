# Contributing to My Wallpaper Collection

First off, thank you for considering contributing! It's awesome to have your help in making this wallpaper collection even better.

## How to Contribute

### Adding New Wallpapers

If you have a wallpaper you'd like to add, here's how you can do it:

1.  **Fork this repository.** Click the 'Fork' button at the top right of this page.
2.  **Clone your forked repository** to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/walls.git
    ```
3.  **Add your wallpaper(s)** to the appropriate category folder (e.g., `nature/`, `anime/`, `abstract/`). If a suitable category doesn't exist, you can create a new one, but please try to keep the categories broad.
4.  **Name your files clearly.** Use descriptive, lowercase names with hyphens (e.g., `beautiful-mountain-sunset.jpg`).
5.  **Optimize your images (optional but appreciated).** If your image files are very large, consider compressing them slightly to reduce file size without significant quality loss. This helps with faster loading.
6.  **Update the `README.md` (optional).** If you're adding a significant number of wallpapers to a category, consider adding a preview image to the `README.md` for that category, following the existing format.
7.  **Commit your changes.** Write a clear and concise commit message.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Add new wallpapers to [Category Name]"
    ```
8.  **Push your changes** to your forked repository.
    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```
9.  **Create a Pull Request.** Go to your forked repository on GitHub and click the 'Compare & pull request' button. Provide a clear description of your changes.
